    /// <p>Expert: policy for deletion of stale <seealso cref="IndexCommit index commits"/>.
    ///
    /// <p>Implement this interface, and pass it to one
    /// of the <seealso cref="IndexWriter"/> or <seealso cref="IndexReader"/>
    /// constructors, to customize when older
    /// <seealso cref="IndexCommit point-in-time commits"/>
    /// are deleted from the index directory.  The default deletion policy
    /// is <seealso cref="KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy"/>, which always
    /// removes old commits as soon as a new commit is done (this
    /// matches the behavior before 2.2).</p>
    ///
    /// <p>One expected use case for this (and the reason why it
    /// was first created) is to work around problems with an
    /// index directory accessed via filesystems like NFS because
    /// NFS does not provide the "delete on last close" semantics
    /// that Lucene's "point in time" search normally relies on.
    /// By implementing a custom deletion policy, such as "a
    /// commit is only removed once it has been stale for more
    /// than X minutes", you can give your readers time to
    /// refresh to the new commit before <seealso cref="IndexWriter"/>
    /// removes the old commits.  Note that doing so will
    /// increase the storage requirements of the index.  See <a
    /// target="top"
    /// href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-710">LUCENE-710</a>
    /// for details.</p>
