    /// IndexReader is an abstract class, providing an interface for accessing an
    /// index.  Search of an index is done entirely through this abstract interface,
    /// so that any subclass which implements it is searchable.
    ///
    /// <p>There are two different types of IndexReaders:
    /// <ul>
    ///  <li><seealso cref="AtomicReader"/>: These indexes do not consist of several sub-readers,
    ///  they are atomic. They support retrieval of stored fields, doc values, terms,
    ///  and postings.
    ///  <li><seealso cref="CompositeReader"/>: Instances (like <seealso cref="DirectoryReader"/>)
    ///  of this reader can only
    ///  be used to get stored fields from the underlying AtomicReaders,
    ///  but it is not possible to directly retrieve postings. To do that, get
    ///  the sub-readers via <seealso cref="CompositeReader#getSequentialSubReaders"/>.
    ///  Alternatively, you can mimic an <seealso cref="AtomicReader"/> (with a serious slowdown),
    ///  by wrapping composite readers with <seealso cref="SlowCompositeReaderWrapper"/>.
    /// </ul>
    ///
    /// <p>IndexReader instances for indexes on disk are usually constructed
    /// with a call to one of the static <code>DirectoryReader.open()</code> methods,
    /// e.g. <seealso cref="DirectoryReader#open(Lucene.Net.Store.Directory)"/>. <seealso cref="DirectoryReader"/> implements
    /// the <seealso cref="CompositeReader"/> interface, it is not possible to directly get postings.
    ///
    /// <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
    /// <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
    /// document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral -- they may change
    /// as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
    /// rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.
    ///
    /// <p>
    /// <a name="thread-safety"></a><p><b>NOTE</b>: {@link
    /// IndexReader} instances are completely thread
    /// safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its methods,
