    /// this allows for an as-cheap-as possible upgrade of an older index by only upgrading segments that
    /// are created by previous Lucene versions. forceMerge does no longer really merge;
    /// it is just used to &quot;forceMerge&quot; older segment versions away.
    /// <p>In general one would use <seealso cref="IndexUpgrader"/>, but for a fully customizeable upgrade,
    /// you can use this like any other {@code MergePolicy} and call <seealso cref="IndexWriter#forceMerge(int)"/>:
    /// <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
    ///  IndexWriterConfig iwc = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_XX, new KeywordAnalyzer());

    ///  IndexWriter w = new IndexWriter(dir, iwc);
    ///  w.forceMerge(1);
    ///  w.close();
    /// </pre>
    /// <p><b>Warning:</b> this merge policy may reorder documents if the index was partially
    /// upgraded before calling forceMerge (e.g., documents were added). If your application relies
    /// on &quot;monotonicity&quot; of doc IDs (which means that the order in which the documents
    /// were added to the index is preserved), do a forceMerge(1) instead. Please note, the
