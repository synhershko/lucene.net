    /// Instances of this reader type can only
    /// be used to get stored fields from the underlying AtomicReaders,
    /// but it is not possible to directly retrieve postings. To do that, get
    /// the <seealso cref="AtomicReaderContext"/> for all sub-readers via <seealso cref="#leaves()"/>.
    /// Alternatively, you can mimic an <seealso cref="AtomicReader"/> (with a serious slowdown),
    /// by wrapping composite readers with <seealso cref="SlowCompositeReaderWrapper"/>.
    ///
    /// <p>IndexReader instances for indexes on disk are usually constructed
    /// with a call to one of the static <code>DirectoryReader.open()</code> methods,
    /// e.g. <seealso cref="DirectoryReader#open(Directory)"/>. <seealso cref="DirectoryReader"/> implements
    /// the {@code CompositeReader} interface, it is not possible to directly get postings.
    /// <p> Concrete subclasses of IndexReader are usually constructed with a call to
    /// one of the static <code>open()</code> methods, e.g. {@link
    /// DirectoryReader#open(Directory)}.
    ///
    /// <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
    /// <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
    /// document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral -- they may change
    /// as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
    /// rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.
