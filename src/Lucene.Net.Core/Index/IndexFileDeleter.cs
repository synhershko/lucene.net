     * this class keeps track of each SegmentInfos instance that
     * is still "live", either because it corresponds to a
     * segments_N file in the Directory (a "commit", i.e. a
     * committed SegmentInfos) or because it's an in-memory
     * SegmentInfos that a writer is actively updating but has
     * not yet committed.  this class uses simple reference
     * counting to map the live SegmentInfos instances to
     * individual files in the Directory.
     *
     * The same directory file may be referenced by more than
     * one IndexCommit, i.e. more than one SegmentInfos.
     * Therefore we count how many commits reference each file.
     * When all the commits referencing a certain file have been
     * deleted, the refcount for that file becomes zero, and the
     * file is deleted.
     *
     * A separate deletion policy interface
     * (IndexDeletionPolicy) is consulted on creation (onInit)
     * and once per commit (onCommit), to decide when a commit
     * should be removed.
     *
     * It is the business of the IndexDeletionPolicy to choose
     * when to delete commit points.  The actual mechanics of
     * file deletion, retrying, etc, derived from the deletion
     * of commit points is the business of the IndexFileDeleter.
     *
     * The current default deletion policy is {@link
     * KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy}, which removes all
     * prior commits when a new commit has completed.  this
     * matches the behavior before 2.2.
     *
     * Note that you must hold the write.lock before
     * instantiating this class.  It opens segments_N file(s)
     * directly with no retry logic.
