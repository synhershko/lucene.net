    /// Java's builtin ThreadLocal has a serious flaw:
    ///  it can take an arbitrarily long amount of time to
    ///  dereference the things you had stored in it, even once the
    ///  ThreadLocal instance itself is no longer referenced.
    ///  this is because there is single, master map stored for
    ///  each thread, which all ThreadLocals share, and that
    ///  master map only periodically purges "stale" entries.
    ///
    ///  While not technically a memory leak, because eventually
    ///  the memory will be reclaimed, it can take a long time
    ///  and you can easily hit OutOfMemoryError because from the
    ///  GC's standpoint the stale entries are not reclaimable.
    ///
    ///  this class works around that, by only enrolling
    ///  WeakReference values into the ThreadLocal, and
    ///  separately holding a hard reference to each stored
    ///  value.  When you call <seealso cref="#close"/>, these hard
    ///  references are cleared and then GC is freely able to
    ///  reclaim space by objects stored in it.
    ///
    ///  We can not rely on <seealso cref="ThreadLocal#remove()"/> as it
    ///  only removes the value for the caller thread, whereas
    ///  <seealso cref="#close"/> takes care of all
    ///  threads.  You should not call <seealso cref="#close"/> until all
    ///  threads are done using the instance.
