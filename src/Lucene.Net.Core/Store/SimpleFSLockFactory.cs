    /// yet spooky warning about not using the API for file
    /// locking.  this warning was added due to <a target="_top"
    /// href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4676183">this
    /// bug</a>, and in fact the only known problem with using
    /// this API for locking is that the Lucene write lock may
    /// not be released when the JVM exits abnormally.</p>
    ///
    /// <p>When this happens, a <seealso cref="LockObtainFailedException"/>
    /// is hit when trying to create a writer, in which case you
    /// need to explicitly clear the lock file first.  You can
    /// either manually remove the file, or use the {@link
    /// Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter#unlock(Directory)}
    /// API.  But, first be certain that no writer is in fact
    /// writing to the index otherwise you can easily corrupt
    /// your index.</p>

    /// <p>Special care needs to be taken if you change the locking
