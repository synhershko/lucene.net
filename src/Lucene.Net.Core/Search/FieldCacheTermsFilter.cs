    /// <summary>
    /// A <seealso cref="Filter"/> that only accepts documents whose single
    /// term value in the specified field is contained in the
    /// provided set of allowed terms.
    ///
    /// <p/>
    ///
    /// this is the same functionality as TermsFilter (from
    /// queries/), except this filter requires that the
    /// field contains only a single term for all documents.
    /// Because of drastically different implementations, they
    /// also have different performance characteristics, as
    /// described below.
    ///
    /// <p/>
    ///
    /// The first invocation of this filter on a given field will
    /// be slower, since a <seealso cref="SortedDocValues"/> must be
    /// created.  Subsequent invocations using the same field
    /// will re-use this cache.  However, as with all
    /// functionality based on <seealso cref="FieldCache"/>, persistent RAM
    /// is consumed to hold the cache, and is not freed until the
    /// <seealso cref="IndexReader"/> is closed.  In contrast, TermsFilter
    /// has no persistent RAM consumption.
    ///
    ///
    /// <p/>
    ///
    /// With each search, this filter translates the specified
    /// set of Terms into a private <seealso cref="FixedBitSet"/> keyed by
    /// term number per unique <seealso cref="IndexReader"/> (normally one
    /// reader per segment).  Then, during matching, the term
    /// number for each docID is retrieved from the cache and
    /// then checked for inclusion using the <seealso cref="FixedBitSet"/>.
    /// Since all testing is done using RAM resident data
    /// structures, performance should be very fast, most likely
    /// fast enough to not require further caching of the
    /// DocIdSet for each possible combination of terms.
    /// However, because docIDs are simply scanned linearly, an
    /// index with a great many small documents may find this
    /// linear scan too costly.
    ///
    /// <p/>
    ///
    /// In contrast, TermsFilter builds up an <seealso cref="FixedBitSet"/>,
    /// keyed by docID, every time it's created, by enumerating
    /// through all matching docs using <seealso cref="DocsEnum"/> to seek
    /// and scan through each term's docID list.  While there is
    /// no linear scan of all docIDs, besides the allocation of
    /// the underlying array in the <seealso cref="FixedBitSet"/>, this
    /// approach requires a number of "disk seeks" in proportion
    /// to the number of terms, which can be exceptionally costly
    /// when there are cache misses in the OS's IO cache.
    ///
    /// <p/>
    ///
    /// Generally, this filter will be slower on the first
    /// invocation for a given field, but subsequent invocations,
    /// even if you change the allowed set of Terms, should be
    /// faster than TermsFilter, especially as the number of
    /// Terms being matched increases.  If you are matching only
    /// a very small number of terms, and those terms in turn
    /// match a very small number of documents, TermsFilter may
    /// perform faster.
    ///
    /// <p/>
    ///
    /// Which filter is best is very application dependent.
