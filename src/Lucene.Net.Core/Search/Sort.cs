    /// <summary>
    /// Encapsulates sort criteria for returned hits.
    ///
    /// <p>The fields used to determine sort order must be carefully chosen.
    /// Documents must contain a single term in such a field,
    /// and the value of the term should indicate the document's relative position in
    /// a given sort order.  The field must be indexed, but should not be tokenized,
    /// and does not need to be stored (unless you happen to want it back with the
    /// rest of your document data).  In other words:
    ///
    /// <p><code>document.add (new Field ("byNumber", Integer.toString(x), Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED));</code></p>
    ///
    ///
    /// <p><h3>Valid Types of Values</h3>
    ///
    /// <p>There are four possible kinds of term values which may be put into
    /// sorting fields: Integers, Longs, Floats, or Strings.  Unless
    /// <seealso cref="SortField SortField"/> objects are specified, the type of value
    /// in the field is determined by parsing the first term in the field.
    ///
    /// <p>Integer term values should contain only digits and an optional
    /// preceding negative sign.  Values must be base 10 and in the range
    /// <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> and <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> inclusive.
    /// Documents which should appear first in the sort
    /// should have low value integers, later documents high values
    /// (i.e. the documents should be numbered <code>1..n</code> where
    /// <code>1</code> is the first and <code>n</code> the last).
    ///
    /// <p>Long term values should contain only digits and an optional
    /// preceding negative sign.  Values must be base 10 and in the range
    /// <code>Long.MIN_VALUE</code> and <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code> inclusive.
    /// Documents which should appear first in the sort
    /// should have low value integers, later documents high values.
    ///
    /// <p>Float term values should conform to values accepted by
    /// <seealso cref="Float Float.valueOf(String)"/> (except that <code>NaN</code>
    /// and <code>Infinity</code> are not supported).
    /// Documents which should appear first in the sort
    /// should have low values, later documents high values.
    ///
    /// <p>String term values can contain any valid String, but should
    /// not be tokenized.  The values are sorted according to their
    /// <seealso cref="Comparable natural order"/>.  Note that using this type
    /// of term value has higher memory requirements than the other
    /// two types.
    ///
    /// <p><h3>Object Reuse</h3>
    ///
    /// <p>One of these objects can be
    /// used multiple times and the sort order changed between usages.
    ///
    /// <p>this class is thread safe.
    ///
    /// <p><h3>Memory Usage</h3>
    ///
    /// <p>Sorting uses of caches of term values maintained by the
    /// internal HitQueue(s).  The cache is static and contains an integer
    /// or float array of length <code>IndexReader.maxDoc()</code> for each field
    /// name for which a sort is performed.  In other words, the size of the
    /// cache in bytes is:
    ///
    /// <p><code>4 * IndexReader.maxDoc() * (# of different fields actually used to sort)</code>
    ///
    /// <p>For String fields, the cache is larger: in addition to the
    /// above array, the value of every term in the field is kept in memory.
    /// If there are many unique terms in the field, this could
    /// be quite large.
    ///
    /// <p>Note that the size of the cache is not affected by how many
    /// fields are in the index and <i>might</i> be used to sort - only by
    /// the ones actually used to sort a result set.
