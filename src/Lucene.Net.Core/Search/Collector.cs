    /// or custom result filtering, collation, etc. </p>
    ///
    /// <p>Lucene's core collectors are derived from Collector.
    /// Likely your application can use one of these classes, or
    /// subclass <seealso cref="TopDocsCollector"/>, instead of
    /// implementing Collector directly:
    ///
    /// <ul>
    ///
    ///   <li><seealso cref="TopDocsCollector"/> is an abstract base class
    ///   that assumes you will retrieve the top N docs,
    ///   according to some criteria, after collection is
    ///   done.  </li>
    ///
    ///   <li><seealso cref="TopScoreDocCollector"/> is a concrete subclass
    ///   <seealso cref="TopDocsCollector"/> and sorts according to score +
    ///   docID.  this is used internally by the {@link
    ///   IndexSearcher} search methods that do not take an
    ///   explicit <seealso cref="Sort"/>. It is likely the most frequently
    ///   used collector.</li>
    ///
    ///   <li><seealso cref="TopFieldCollector"/> subclasses {@link
    ///   TopDocsCollector} and sorts according to a specified
    ///   <seealso cref="Sort"/> object (sort by field).  this is used
    ///   internally by the <seealso cref="IndexSearcher"/> search methods
    ///   that take an explicit <seealso cref="Sort"/>.
    ///
    ///   <li><seealso cref="TimeLimitingCollector"/>, which wraps any other
    ///   Collector and aborts the search if it's taken too much
    ///   time.</li>
    ///
    ///   <li><seealso cref="PositiveScoresOnlyCollector"/> wraps any other
    ///   Collector and prevents collection of hits whose score
    ///   is &lt;= 0.0</li>
    ///
    /// </ul>
    ///
    /// <p>Collector decouples the score from the collected doc:
    /// the score computation is skipped entirely if it's not
    /// needed.  Collectors that do need the score should
    /// implement the <seealso cref="#setScorer"/> method, to hold onto the
    /// passed <seealso cref="Scorer"/> instance, and call {@link
    /// Scorer#score()} within the collect method to compute the
    /// current hit's score.  If your collector may request the
    /// score for a single hit multiple times, you should use
    /// <seealso cref="ScoreCachingWrappingScorer"/>. </p>
    ///
    /// <p><b>NOTE:</b> The doc that is passed to the collect
    /// method is relative to the current reader. If your
    /// collector needs to resolve this to the docID space of the
    /// Multi*Reader, you must re-base it by recording the
    /// docBase from the most recent setNextReader call.  Here's
    /// a simple example showing how to collect docIDs into a
    /// BitSet:</p>
    ///
    /// <pre class="prettyprint">

    ///
    ///   <em>// ignore scorer</em>
    ///   public void setScorer(Scorer scorer) {
    ///   }
    ///
    ///   <em>// accept docs out of order (for a BitSet it doesn't matter)</em>
    ///   public boolean acceptsDocsOutOfOrder() {
    ///     return true;
    ///   }
    ///
    ///   public void collect(int doc) {
    ///     bits.set(doc + docBase);
    ///   }
    ///
    ///   public void setNextReader(AtomicReaderContext context) {
    ///     this.docBase = context.docBase;
    ///   }
    /// });
    /// </pre>
    ///
    /// <p>Not all collectors will need to rebase the docID.  For
    /// example, a collector that simply counts the total number
    /// of hits would skip it.</p>
    ///
    /// <p><b>NOTE:</b> Prior to 2.9, Lucene silently filtered
