    /* Description from Doug Cutting (excerpted from
     * LUCENE-1483):
     *
     * BooleanScorer uses an array to score windows of
     * 2K docs. So it scores docs 0-2K first, then docs 2K-4K,
     * etc. For each window it iterates through all query terms
     * and accumulates a score in table[doc%2K]. It also stores
     * in the table a bitmask representing which terms
     * contributed to the score. Non-zero scores are chained in
     * a linked list. At the end of scoring each window it then
     * iterates through the linked list and, if the bitmask
     * matches the boolean constraints, collects a hit. For
     * boolean queries with lots of frequent terms this can be
     * much faster, since it does not need to update a priority
     * queue for each posting, instead performing constant-time
     * operations per posting. The only downside is that it
     * results in hits being delivered out-of-order within the
     * window, which means it cannot be nested within other
     * scorers. But it works well as a top-level scorer.
     *
     * The new BooleanScorer2 implementation instead works by
     * merging priority queues of postings, albeit with some
     * clever tricks. For example, a pure conjunction (all terms
     * required) does not require a priority queue. Instead it
     * sorts the posting streams at the start, then repeatedly
     * skips the first to to the last. If the first ever equals
     * the last, then there's a hit. When some terms are
     * required and some terms are optional, the conjunction can
     * be evaluated first, then the optional terms can all skip
     * to the match and be added to the score. Thus the
     * conjunction can reduce the number of priority queue
     * updates for the optional terms. */
