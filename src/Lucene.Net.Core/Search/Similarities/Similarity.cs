    /// Similarity defines the components of Lucene scoring.
    /// <p>
    /// Expert: Scoring API.
    /// <p>
    /// this is a low-level API, you should only extend this API if you want to implement
    /// an information retrieval <i>model</i>.  If you are instead looking for a convenient way
    /// to alter Lucene's scoring, consider extending a higher-level implementation
    /// such as <seealso cref="TFIDFSimilarity"/>, which implements the vector space model with this API, or
    /// just tweaking the default implementation: <seealso cref="DefaultSimilarity"/>.
    /// <p>
    /// Similarity determines how Lucene weights terms, and Lucene interacts with
    /// this class at both <a href="#indextime">index-time</a> and
    /// <a href="#querytime">query-time</a>.
    /// <p>
    /// <a name="indextime"/>
    /// At indexing time, the indexer calls <seealso cref="#computeNorm(FieldInvertState)"/>, allowing
    /// the Similarity implementation to set a per-document value for the field that will
    /// be later accessible via <seealso cref="AtomicReader#getNormValues(String)"/>.  Lucene makes no assumption
    /// about what is in this norm, but it is most useful for encoding length normalization
    /// information.
    /// <p>
    /// Implementations should carefully consider how the normalization is encoded: while
    /// Lucene's classical <seealso cref="TFIDFSimilarity"/> encodes a combination of index-time boost
    /// and length normalization information with <seealso cref="SmallFloat"/> into a single byte, this
    /// might not be suitable for all purposes.
    /// <p>
    /// Many formulas require the use of average document length, which can be computed via a
    /// combination of <seealso cref="CollectionStatistics#sumTotalTermFreq()"/> and
    /// <seealso cref="CollectionStatistics#maxDoc()"/> or <seealso cref="CollectionStatistics#docCount()"/>,
    /// depending upon whether the average should reflect field sparsity.
    /// <p>
    /// Additional scoring factors can be stored in named
    /// <code>NumericDocValuesField</code>s and accessed
    /// at query-time with <seealso cref="AtomicReader#getNumericDocValues(String)"/>.
    /// <p>
    /// Finally, using index-time boosts (either via folding into the normalization byte or
    /// via DocValues), is an inefficient way to boost the scores of different fields if the
    /// boost will be the same for every document, instead the Similarity can simply take a constant
    /// boost parameter <i>C</i>, and <seealso cref="PerFieldSimilarityWrapper"/> can return different
    /// instances with different boosts depending upon field name.
    /// <p>
    /// <a name="querytime"/>
    /// At query-time, Queries interact with the Similarity via these steps:
    /// <ol>
    ///   <li>The <seealso cref="#computeWeight(float, CollectionStatistics, TermStatistics...)"/> method is called a single time,
    ///       allowing the implementation to compute any statistics (such as IDF, average document length, etc)
    ///       across <i>the entire collection</i>. The <seealso cref="TermStatistics"/> and <seealso cref="CollectionStatistics"/> passed in
    ///       already contain all of the raw statistics involved, so a Similarity can freely use any combination
    ///       of statistics without causing any additional I/O. Lucene makes no assumption about what is
    ///       stored in the returned <seealso cref="Similarity.SimWeight"/> object.
    ///   <li>The query normalization process occurs a single time: <seealso cref="Similarity.SimWeight#getValueForNormalization()"/>
    ///       is called for each query leaf node, <seealso cref="Similarity#queryNorm(float)"/> is called for the top-level
    ///       query, and finally <seealso cref="Similarity.SimWeight#normalize(float, float)"/> passes down the normalization value
    ///       and any top-level boosts (e.g. from enclosing <seealso cref="BooleanQuery"/>s).
    ///   <li>For each segment in the index, the Query creates a <seealso cref="#simScorer(SimWeight, AtomicReaderContext)"/>
    ///       The score() method is called for each matching document.
    /// </ol>
    /// <p>
    /// <a name="explaintime"/>
    /// When <seealso cref="IndexSearcher#explain(Lucene.Net.Search.Query, int)"/> is called, queries consult the Similarity's DocScorer for an
