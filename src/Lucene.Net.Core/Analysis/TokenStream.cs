    /// A <code>TokenStream</code> enumerates the sequence of tokens, either from
    /// <seealso cref="Field"/>s of a <seealso cref="Document"/> or from query text.
    /// <p>
    /// this is an abstract class; concrete subclasses are:
    /// <ul>
    /// <li><seealso cref="Tokenizer"/>, a <code>TokenStream</code> whose input is a Reader; and
    /// <li><seealso cref="TokenFilter"/>, a <code>TokenStream</code> whose input is another
    /// <code>TokenStream</code>.
    /// </ul>
    /// A new <code>TokenStream</code> API has been introduced with Lucene 2.9. this API
    /// has moved from being <seealso cref="Token"/>-based to <seealso cref="Attribute"/>-based. While
    /// <seealso cref="Token"/> still exists in 2.9 as a convenience class, the preferred way
    /// to store the information of a <seealso cref="Token"/> is to use <seealso cref="AttributeImpl"/>s.
    /// <p>
    /// <code>TokenStream</code> now extends <seealso cref="AttributeSource"/>, which provides
    /// access to all of the token <seealso cref="Attribute"/>s for the <code>TokenStream</code>.
    /// Note that only one instance per <seealso cref="AttributeImpl"/> is created and reused
    /// for every token. this approach reduces object creation and allows local
    /// caching of references to the <seealso cref="AttributeImpl"/>s. See
    /// <seealso cref="#IncrementToken()"/> for further details.
    /// <p>
    /// <b>The workflow of the new <code>TokenStream</code> API is as follows:</b>
    /// <ol>
    /// <li>Instantiation of <code>TokenStream</code>/<seealso cref="TokenFilter"/>s which add/get
    /// attributes to/from the <seealso cref="AttributeSource"/>.
    /// <li>The consumer calls <seealso cref="TokenStream#reset()"/>.
    /// <li>The consumer retrieves attributes from the stream and stores local
    /// references to all attributes it wants to access.
    /// <li>The consumer calls <seealso cref="#IncrementToken()"/> until it returns false
    /// consuming the attributes after each call.
    /// <li>The consumer calls <seealso cref="#end()"/> so that any end-of-stream operations
    /// can be performed.
    /// <li>The consumer calls <seealso cref="#close()"/> to release any resource when finished
    /// using the <code>TokenStream</code>.
    /// </ol>
    /// To make sure that filters and consumers know which attributes are available,
    /// the attributes must be added during instantiation. Filters and consumers are
    /// not required to check for availability of attributes in
    /// <seealso cref="#IncrementToken()"/>.
    /// <p>
    /// You can find some example code for the new API in the analysis package level
    /// Javadoc.
    /// <p>
    /// Sometimes it is desirable to capture a current state of a <code>TokenStream</code>,
    /// e.g., for buffering purposes (see <seealso cref="CachingTokenFilter"/>,
    /// TeeSinkTokenFilter). For this usecase
    /// <seealso cref="AttributeSource#captureState"/> and <seealso cref="AttributeSource#restoreState"/>
    /// can be used.
    /// <p>The {@code TokenStream}-API in Lucene is based on the decorator pattern.
    /// Therefore all non-abstract subclasses must be final or have at least a final
    /// implementation of <seealso cref="#incrementToken"/>! this is checked when Java
    /// assertions are enabled.
